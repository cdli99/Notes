Web programming really should be as simple as Sinatra.

I've been using Jave like J2EE, then Spring; and Ruby Rails, but feels Sinatra really simplify the web programming techincally and mindly.

Here is what I will choose for next web project:
``` ruby
if static_language then
  spring_boot
else
  if java_script then
    nodejs
  elsif ruby
    sinatra
  else
    ...
  end
end
```
