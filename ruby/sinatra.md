Web programming really should be as simple as Sinatra.

I've been using Jave like J2EE, then Spring; and Ruby Rails, but feels Sinatra really simplify the web programming techincally and mindly.

Here is what I will choose for next web project:
``` ruby
if static_language then
  spring_boot
else
  if java_script then
    nodejs
  elsif ruby
    sinatra
  else
    ...
  end
end
```

## Sinatra
Sinatra is a *domain-specific language* for building websites, web services, and web applications in Ruby. It emphasizes a minimalistic approach to development, offering only what is essential to handle HTTP reequests and deliver responses to clients.
* Built for speed
* Minimalism
* Low memory usage

Sinatra applications can also be embedded into other Ruby web applications, packaged as a gem for wider distribution, and so on.
* Sinatra is not a framework.
* Sinatra does not implement MVC. 
* Maintained by Heroku
