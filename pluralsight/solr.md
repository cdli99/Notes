## Overview (Geting started class)

* Architecture
* Solr configuration
* Content: Schema, solor config and indexing
* Searching and relevance
* Put UI on it

### Enterprise search
Practice of generating content and making it searchable to a defined audience out of multiple enterprise-type data sources like databases or CMS.
* Simplicity
* Intelligence analysis

### Solr
* Open source
* Dynamic content
* Fast and sophisticated search
* Active community
* Searches an inverted index instead of searching through the text
* Simplicity is the ultimate sophisticaiton
* solr cloud with Apache zookeeper

### Functions of search engine
* Indexing - organize all content for quick access
* Query parsing - understand what the user is looking fo
* search and browse - quickly find the information of interest
* security - filter out documents the user is not allowed to see
* relevance ranking - order the information in useful ways by relavance

## Architecture
[This picture](https://github.com/p4ali/Notes/blob/master/pluralsight/solr_arch.jpg) describe the components.
* Solr is sererization of Lucene, an open-source search platform
* Lucene is open-source **search** and **indexing** engine. Works with any docuemnt which has fields that can be extracted and indexed.

## Related Apache projects
* Hadoop: platform to create distributed systems
* Mahout: machine learning library
* Nutch: Web crawler
* OpenNLP: machine learning library for peocessing natural language
* Tika: parser to detect and extract meta data.

## Search Applicaiton
* It is to make user's life easier. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
* Addtional aids include "did you mean", synonyms,autosuggest, spell check, phonetic search, lemmatize and more

## Play with Solr
* Download solr from [http://lucene.apache.org/solr/](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/)
* Unzip to /opt/solr-4.10.2
* The /opt/solr-4.10.2/example is a full solr application
* Start solr
* upload data with post.jar
```bash
# in a terminal
$ cd /opt/solr-4.10.2/example
$ java -jar start.jar # start solr web server in http://localhost:8983/solr

# in a different terminal
$ cd /opt/solr-4.10.2/example/exampledocs
$ java -jar post.jar -help # help doc
$ java -jar post.jar *.xml # import *.xml file into solr.
  implePostTool version 1.5

# Once imported, you will see the num docs files changed from 0 to 32.
```

### Other upload mechanisms
* DataImportHandler
* Add XML, Json, CSV documents
* SOlrNet or SolrJ
* Multiple tools that post documents to Solr's index
 * ASPIRE

### Query
* [http://localhost:8983/solr/select?q=video](http://localhost:8983/solr/select?q=video)
* The above url mad up of
 * host name (localhsot) & port number (8389)
 * Application name (solr)
 * Request handler for queries (select)
 * Query itself (q=video)
* A core is a running lucene instance with all solr configuration.
* The query result has following format
```
response
  responseHeader
    status
    QTime
    params
      p1
      p2
      ...
      pn
  result
    doc1
      field1
      ...
      fieldn
    ...
    docn
```
## Content: Schemas, Documents and Indexing
* Document - Basic unit of information, set of data that describes something and made up of fields.
```json
{
"courseid": "scrum-development-jira-agile",
"coursetitle": "Scrum Developement with Jira & JIRA Agile from Xavier",
"Everything":{
  "Scrum development",
  "Having a great idea to start"
},
"durationinseconds":5834,
"releasedate":"2014-11-12T00:00:00Z",
"description": "Having a great idea is just the start, impl and exec are key, improve your chances of"
}
```
* Fields - Fields contain different types of data, and tell solr how to interpret it with field type. e.g., courseid, cousetitle, and so on. 
 * copy field - data may be interpreted in more than one way, such as query time and index time. Copy data into different fields and field type
 * Dynamic field - fields that are not defined until indexing
 * Each field can have many different attributes.
```xml
<!-- field attributes -->
<field name="description" type="text_general" indexed="true" stored="true"/>

name: field name
type: field type
indexed: true if indexed (searchable|sortable)
stored: true if retrievable
compressed: [fasle] stored using gzip compression
multivalued: true if multiple values per document
required: instruct solr to reject if missing
DocValues: if true, the value will be put in a column-oriented DocValues structure
OmitNorms: true omits the norms associated with this field
TermVectors: [false] true to store the term vector for a given field
TermPositions: store position info with the term vector
TermOffsets: store offset information with the term vector
Default: value if none providing on adding document
```
* Schema.xml - contains details about document fields and how to treat when documents added to or queried from the index. It is not viable to change the schema after document added to the index. It declare
 * fields, field types & attributes
 * primary key (unique) field
 * which field are required
 * how to index and search
 * Schemaless mode allow index data without manually modifying schema
 ```xml
 <schema>
   <types>
   <fields>
   <uniqueKey>
   <defaultSearchField>
   <solrQueryParser defaultOperator>
   <copyField>
 </schema>
 ```
* Solrconfig -

## TERM
* Term vector - a documentâ€™s term vector is simply of listing for each term in the entire corpus with how frequent the term occurs in this document. e.g. In document "Hello world", the vector is [1,1], whose element is the frequency of ["Hello", "world"]. 
* Inverted index - Solr is able to achieve fast search responses because, instead of searching the text directly, it searches an index instead. This is like retrieving pages in a book related to a keyword by scanning the index at the back of a book, as opposed to searching every word of every page of the book. This type of index is called an **inverted index**, because it inverts a page-centric data structure (page->words) to a keyword-centric data structure (word->pages).
 * An index consists of one or more Documents, and a Document consists of one or more Fields.
