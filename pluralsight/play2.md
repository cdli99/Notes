With Scala/Play, you pretty much have the same experience as working with ruby/rails, and still kepp the advantage of JVM.

## Setup
* Download `activator` 2.3.8
* Create a new application
 * with activator: `activator new my-first-app play-scala`
 * without activator: 
  * create application directory
  * create build.sbt
  * run sbt
* Run application
 * with activator console: run `activator` to start console, then `run`, or with triggered run: `~run`
 * run without activator console: `activatro run`
* Import into IDE
 * Eclipse: start activator console, then `eclipse with-source=true`, then import existing proejct into workspace
 * IntelliJ: `New > Project from existing sources...` or `idea`, then open project in the folder
