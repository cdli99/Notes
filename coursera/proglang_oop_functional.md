## OOP versus Fuctional Decomposition
* FP(Functional Programming) approach
 * break programs down into functions that perform some operation
 * define each function to handle each case of data
* OOP(Object Oriented Programming) approach (opposite way to functional approach)
 * break programs down into classes that give ehavior to some kine of data
 * define each data as class to handle each function

* FP and OOP often doing the same thing in exact oppoiste way - organize the program "by rows" or "by columns".
* Which is the "most natual" may depend on what you are doing (e.g., an interpreter (FP) vs a GUI (OOP)) or personal taste.
* Code layout is important, but there is no perfect way since software has many dimensions of structure
 * tools, IDEs can help with multiple "views" (e.g., rows/columns)
