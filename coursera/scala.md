## Programming Paradigms

* Imperative programming - modify mutable variables using assiments and control structures.
 * theory does not define mutationss
  * one or more data types
  * operations on these types
  * laws that describe the relationship between values and operation

* Evaluation
 * substitution model
  * call-by-name and call-by-value
  * if CBV terminates, then CBN terminates, and same value. But the other direction is not true.
