Javascript use Promise to handle longtime operation asnychronously. You can start a long time operation, and then notify Promise at the end of the operation, whether it succeed or fail.

To Java developer, promise is similar to Task in Eclipse or Future in Java. (http://wildermuth.com/2013/8/3/JavaScript_Promises)

To register callback, you need  call then(successHandler, failureHandler)
