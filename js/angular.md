MVC
----
* The model is the truth. Your entire application is driven by the model.
* The controller is the business logic: how to retrive the model, what kind of operation to perform on it.
* The template represents how your model is displayed, and how the user will interact withe the application.
** display your model
** define the way user can interact with the applicaiton (clicks, input fields, and so on)
** styling the app
** filtering and formatting your data (both input and output)
