# Why Go to Tea?
Carrie EwingCarrie Ewing Email Carrie Ewing (VP of Operations)

If you’ve worked here for any length of time you’ve noticed that there’s an emphasis on spending time together via plenty of events and ample common areas in all of offices. Rational for this is the familiar notion that time together builds good relationships and helps to develop social skills in all of us. This article is in support of spending time together and building those social skills by going to Tea.  (If there is not a scheduled Tea time in your office, I betcha there’s an event that’s similar, so keep reading-you.)  

Why go to Tea? Because it’s good for you and good for our business. Many of our commandments are about supporting each other and those good social skills like listening, appreciation, respect, etc. heck, you can read them. When you go to Tea you talk and hopefully listen. huh?  You could talk about this GitLab business, listen to your boss (yeh, right), meet a newcomer, or simply take a small break and drink a cup of tea.

You’ve got to balance attending these functions like Tea with everything else you’ve got to do, like your work. It’s considered poor form to drop out of a meeting to attend Tea (eh hem..or go to your massage) so keep your participation in perspective; and give your manager a break by making certain you are in alignment on participation. I haven’t made attending Tea a top priority, but I’m vowing to change this. The next Tea time in Alameda is 10am, August 13th…maybe I’ll see you there. (Hey, Rome wasn’t built in a day.) 

I found this article on scordo.com-the italian life for everyone. I think it does a pretty good job at articulating why time together is time well spent, here’s a snippet:

> Italians are generally viewed as a very social and outgoing.  Italian society puts great emphasis on communications and > personal relationships and its part of the reason why Italians have a reputation for conveying warmth and openness with > both native and non-natives alike. In turn, here are five advantages associated with having good social skills, gleamed > from our Italian American upbringing:

## More Relationships

Identifying with individuals leads to both relationships and, at times, friendships.   And, as most people know, you can’t advance very far in life without being able to leverage relationships.  Focusing on relationships will help you land a job, advance in your job, make new friends, and give you a better outlook on life (a large social network equals satisfaction with life).

## Great Communication Skills

Relating with people and being able to work in large groups inadvertently develops one’s communications skills.  After all, you can’t have great social skills without good communications skills and, in my view, being able to convey one’s thoughts and ideas maybe the single most important business skill of all time.

## More Efficiency

If you’re good with people you can probably avoid being with the people you don’t like very much. For example, many folks dread social interactions because they don’t want to spend time with individuals who do not have similar interests and viewpoints.   So, if you’re at a business get together and don’t want to spend time with Joe because he can’t help you close a particular deal, a great set of social skills will allow you to politely convey that you need to spend time with other folks at the get together.

## A Better Career

Most worthwhile jobs have a people component and the most lucrative positions often involve a large amount of time spent interacting with employees, media, colleagues, etc.  It’s a rare individual who can isolate himself in his office and still excel in his or her job.  Most organizations are looking for individuals with a particular, tactical, skill set and the ability to influence people to get things done.

## Increased Quality of Life / Happiness

Getting along with people will open up many personal and career-related doors.  Striking up a conversation at a work related conference may lead to a new job offer with a higher salary or a smile and hello at your local tennis club may grab you a new tennis partner!  It’s also been widely acknowledged that retirees with a large social network have a higher level of happiness during their later years versus depressed and lonely 60-somethings who spend the majority of their free time watching TV with little or no social activities planned.

There are many ways you can find out when the next Tea time or Perforce sponsored event is happening in your locale, such as the Upcoming Events section in the Sync, one of the office calendars (see Alameda/ Wokingham) or by asking your local Office Admin team (Be sure to thank them too)!

Tea anyone?
