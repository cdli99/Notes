## Goal
* give effective feedback to your boss, peers, and subordinates without blame or judgement
* understand the difference between offering an opinion and given feedback;
* understand why giving effective feedback is your most important leadership tool and kill
* be prepared to recieve feedback that you will use for your own growth and development

## Two kind of feedback
1. Opinions, thoughts, suggestions about a work product
 * How you see the situation (You personal likes and dislikes)
 * A judgement formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or observation
 * Appropriate when developing a product or a new strategy
 * Given to enable product improvement
2. Observations about behavior and the impact of the behavior
 * Focuses on behavior and impact of a specific behavior
 * Based on observations, not personal preferences
 * Is focused on improvement of an individual's behavior or performance
 * Given to enable another person's success

## What happens when effective feedback is given?
* The other walks away unerstanding exactly what he or she did and the impact the behavior had on your or the organization
* the receiver learns by repeating or avoiding that behavior in hte future
* Employee retention is increased; lack of feedback is one of the top two reasons excellent performers leave their jobs.
* Receivers feel respected. They will know how to improve.

**Giving effective feedback rquires the same attention to detail that you employ when soving a business or technical problem**

### The Johari window
Key idea:
* Individuals can build trust with others by disclosing information about themselves
* Individuals can learn about themselves with the help of feedback from others
* Self-disclosure can enlarge the open area by reduce the unknow area by others
* Feedback enlarge the open area by reduce teh unknown area by self

## Common mistakes
* The feedback judges the individual, not the behavior (e.g., you are very abrasive in meetings)
* The feed back is too vague. (e.g., lyou are a good leader)
* The feedback is exaggerated with generalities. (e.g., you always show up late to my meetings)
* The feedback analyzed motives. (e.g., you were inconsiderate by being late to our meeting.)
* The feedback goes on too long. (e.g., blah, blah, blah...)
* The feedback implies a threat. (e.g., Do you wanto succeed in this orgnization or not?)
* The feedback is a question, not a statement. (e.g., do you think you could listen next time I give instruction?)
* Bringing in your own experiences. (e.g., I used to have the same problem.)
* Cushioning the feedback. (e.g., you are not going to like this...)
* Delaying the feedback. (e.g., For years ago when we attended the trade slow in Las Vegas...)
* The feedback is second hand. (e.g., John said he is unhappy with your work.)
 * About second-hand feedback: 
  * Is almost always edited and unclear
  * Should be redirected to the person involved
  * Encourages fear and distrust
  * Allow people to avoid taking responsibility for direct communiation.

## How to give feedback (Situation-Bahavior-Impact SBI)

### Capture the situation: Where or when did the behavior occur?
 * Yesterday moring while we were inspecting the building...
 * Last week, during our regular staff meeting...
 * Today when you and I were talking in your office...
 * Last weekend at the staff party...
### Describe the behavior: What were the specific actions that were observed?
 * What you can see
 * what you can hear
 * What the person did or did not do
 * Words and non-verbal behaviors
### Deliver the impact: what ere the consequence of the behavior?
   * Make a statement about the person's behavior
     * When you turned in the report two days early, I was abel to consider all of your recommendations. The result was a much better final report.
     * When you ended the conversation after only 5 minutes, I wondered if you were intereested in my opinion.
   * Or acknowledge the emotional effect the behavior had on you
     * When you asked my contribution to the meeting this morning, I felt appreciated
     * When you told me my concerns were overblown, I felt discounted.
### Examples

> Jan, the logic of your argumentmin that meeting this morning was very persuasive. You 
> have my complete attention and your presentaion moved me from skepticism to enthusiasm.
>
> Jan, I didn't understand your argument in hte meeting this morninig. You repeated one
> point several times and were unable to answer my question. As a result, I am still skeptical
> about moving forward with the project.

-----------

> Sam, I appreciate you keepingme up to date on a weekly basis about your project.
> As a result, I've been able to pass on key information in a way that I haven't done before,
> and we were able to read a key milestone ahead of schedule.
>
> Sam, you have't kept me informat about your progress on the project. As a result,
> we missed a key milestone and I'm beginning to wonder about your ability to manage the project.

----------

> Tamara, I've noticed that you've made helpfult comments during the last three staff meetings.

---------------

-----------------

> Tom, I noticed you were one of only a few people to stay after the holiday party and clean up

> part of the culture here to join in and help after events. You missed the opportunity to 
> show that you are a team player.

### Your delivery technique
* Remember your only reason for giving feedback is to help another person succeed.
* Find a private setting and give you undivided attention.
* Soften the opening. (e.g., "May I share an observation with your?")
* When giving feedback to a direct report, be prepared ot offer suggestions and supprot for changing behavior
* Recognize that prople process information differently
* Your choice of words might be the least importand part of the feedback
* After you've given the feedback, reflect on how it went and if it did not go as planned, decide what you will do differently next time.
* Recognize that you do not have to be "comfortable" to give feedback; it's your job.
* Consider the impact of non-verbal behavior:

| Percentage   | description |
|:-------------|:-------------|
| 7%  | Of the message is communicted by workds - the content |
| 38% | by voice tone |
| 55% | by non-verbal's (posture, gestures, facial expressions, etc.)|
| 93% | of the message is NOT content|

## Giving positive vx. "negative feedback"
* Catch people doing things right. Positive feedback is the most powerful tool you have in shaping behavior.
* "You're doing a great job" feels good but means nothing. Be specific with your positive and constructive feedback.
* Strike a balance between positive feedback (specific comments on a job well done) and feedback about problematic behavior that needs to be addressed. Ideally feedback is 4:1 positive to negative, over time.
* Leverage strenghts. Give people credit for everything they do right. It is through her strengths that he or she will be able to address shortcomings.
* Avoid the "praise sandwich." Offer positive and constructive feedback separately.
* Consider the experience and competence level of the person receiving the feedback. Research has shown that when people are experts on a subject, they are more eager to hear negative feedback, while novices are more eager to seek encouragement or positive comments.
* Remember the purpose of feedback. It's not to make others feel better - it's to help them do better. Often the best way to do that is to reinforce positive successful behaviors with specific examples.

## Demonstration and practice
## How to give feedback to your boss
### What o consider
* THe cost-benefit of giving feedback to your boss
* THe difference between what you really need from your boss to perform well in your job and what would be "nice" to have
* The timing and how sharing it will affect your manager

### How to do it
* privately!
* Write it down
* ask for permission
* approach this as an opportunity to improve the situation. (This is not a free pas to unload on your boss)
* Use SBI rigorously. Offer examples or details.
* Address one issue at a time (no gunny-sacking)
* speak only for yourself
* Keep it between you and your boss. No one else needs to know
* when your boss asks you for feedback, ge clear on exactly what he or she is asking. Schedule a time to talk. (just because your boss asked for it doesn't mean you should skimp on hte preparation.)
* Keep it classy, professional, and kind.
* remember that this takes careful propartion, thought, and empathy.

## How and when to ask for feedback
### Who to ask
* A person you respect
* Someone with credibility and integrity
* Someone with a different work style
* Someone you trust
* Somone with whom you must itneract in order for you both to be successful
* Someone who has had the opportunity to observe you in action

### When to ask for it
After you've identified a developemental goal (through reflection, other feedback, a 360 survey, and another assessment).

### How to asd for it
* Be specific about the behavior(s) on which you want feedback
* State your goal and ask another person for his or her observations.
* If appropriate, use the SBI model (e.g., "I am working on speaking up more frequently in staff meetings. Could you give me some feedback about the impact of my comments on the group?")

### What to do with it
* Be curious!
* Consider accuracy (e.g. On what is the feeback based?)
* Consider importance (Is it helpful? Relavant? Do you want ot know more?)
* Decide what you will do with it (Anything. Not all feedback should be acted upon. Even if you don't like it, some feedback cannot be ignored.)
* Do not make exeuses or try to explain. Simply listen.
* Thanks the person for his or her feedback.

## Learing feedforward
Try feedforward instead of feedback - by Marshall Goldsmith
* Pick one behavior that you would like to change - something that will make a significant change in your situation, how you work, or how you feel
* Descirbe this behavior to selected fellow participants. Thsi is done in one-on-one dialogues. It can be done quite simply, such as, "I want to be a better listener"
* Ask for feedforward - for two suggestions for the future that might help you achive a positive change in your selected behavior. Participants are not allowed to give feedback about the past - only ideas for the future.
* Listen attentively ot the suggestions and take notes. Do not comment on the suggestions even to make positive judgemental statements, such as, "That's a good idea."
* Thank the other paticipants for their suggestions.
* Ask the other person what he or she would like to change
* Provide feedforward - tow suggestions aimed at helping the other person change
* Sy, "You are welcome" when thanked for the suggestions. The entire process of both giving and receiving feedforward usually takes about two minutes.
* Find another participant and keep repeating the proess until the activity is stopped.

### Six reasons to try feedforward by marshall goldsmith
1. We can change the future. We can't change the past.
  * feed forward helps people envision and focus on a positive future, not a failed past. By giving people ideas on how they can be even more successful, we can increase their chances of achiveing this success in the future.
2. It can be more productive to help people be "right" than prove they were "wrong"
  * Even constructively delivered feedback is often seem as negative as it necessarily involves as discussion of mistakes, shorfalls, and problems. Feedforwad, on the other hand, is almost always seen as positive because it focuses on solutions - not problems.
3. Feedforward is especially suited to successful people
  * Successfule people like getting ideas that are aimed at helping them achive their goals. We all tend to accept feedback that is consistent with the way we see ourselves.
4. Feedforwad can come from anyone who knows about the task. If does not require personal experience with the individual
  * One very common positive reaction to feedforward is that participants are amazed by how much they can learn. For example, if you want to be a better listener, almost any fellow leader can give you ideas on how you can improve. Feedforward just requires having good ideas for achieveing the task.
5. People do not take feedorward as personally as feedback
  * If not delivered well, feedback can be taken personally. Succcessful people's sense of identity is highly connected with their work.
  * Feedfoward acnnot involve a personal critique, since it is disucssing something that has not yet happened.
6. Feedforward can cover almost all of the same "material" as feedback
  * Imagine that you have just made a terribel presentation in front of the exceutive committee. Your manager is in the romm. Rather than make your "relive" this experience, your manager might help you prepare for future presentations by giving you suggestions for the future. These suggestions can be very specific and still develered in a positive helpful way.

## Ten key points for giving effective feedback
* The purpose of giving feedback is to enable success (for you, the other person, and the orginization)
* Giving effective feedback requires the same amount of focus and energy that you use when solving any organizational, business, or technical problem.
* 80% of feedback should be positive
* The amoutn of feedback you get is reduced as you move to higher positions in the company
* When giving feedback, be specific and focus onthe behavior (SBI: Situation, Behavior, Impact)
* Most of your message is conveyed by voice tone and other non-verbal behaviors.
* If you're not getting the feedback you want or need, ASK for it.
* Impact trumps intent
* Be proactive and use "feed-forward". It's always easier to change the future that the past.
* Don't expect gratitude when you give feedback. Remember...it's your job.

## Example of Feedback-forward
### How to speak more effectively in a group meeting?
* Prepare, rehearsal, treat it as same way as presentation rehearsal.
* Give yourself a time frame, e.g., I must say something by 10:15
* Do your homework regarding the meeting topic. And anticipate some questions and try to answer them prior to the meeting.
* Speadk slower and louder, especially if you are note a native English speaker
* Try to extend your vocabulary, learn and use new words.
