## Goal
* give effective feedback to your boss, peers, and subordinates without blame or judgement
* understand the difference between offering an opinion and given feedback;
* understand why giving effective feedback is your most important leadership tool and kill
* be prepared to recieve feedback that you will use for your own growth and development

## Two kind of feedback
1. Opinions, thoughts, suggestions about a work product
 * How you see the situation (You personal likes and dislikes)
 * A judgement formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or observation
 * Appropriate when developing a product or a new strategy
 * Given to enable product improvement
2. Observations about behavior and the impact of the behavior
 * Focuses on behavior and impact of a specific behavior
 * Based on observations, not personal preferences
 * Is focused on improvement of an individual's behavior or performance
 * Given to enable another person's success

## What happens when effective feedback is given?
* The other walks away unerstanding exactly what he or she did and the impact the behavior had on your or the organization
* the receiver learns by repeating or avoiding that behavior in hte future
* Employee retention is increased; lack of feedback is one of the top two reasons excellent performers leave their jobs.
* Receivers feel respected. They will know how to improve.

**Giving effective feedback rquires the same attention to detail that you employ when soving a business or technical problem**

### The Johari window
Key idea:
* Individuals can build trust with others by disclosing information about themselves
* Individuals can learn about themselves with the help of feedback from others
* Self-disclosure can enlarge the open area by reduce the unknow area by others
* Feedback enlarge the open area by reduce teh unknown area by self

## Common mistakes
* The feedback judges the individual, not the behavior (e.g., you are very abrasive in meetings)
* The feed back is too vague. (e.g., lyou are a good leader)
* The feedback is exaggerated with generalities. (e.g., you always show up late to my meetings)
* The feedback analyzed motives. (e.g., you were inconsiderate by being late to our meeting.)
* The feedback goes on too long. (e.g., blah, blah, blah...)
* The feedback implies a threat. (e.g., Do you wanto succeed in this orgnization or not?)
* The feedback is a question, not a statement. (e.g., do you think you could listen next time I give instruction?)
* Bringing in your own experiences. (e.g., I used to have the same problem.)
* Cushioning the feedback. (e.g., you are not going to like this...)
* Delaying the feedback. (e.g., For years ago when we attended the trade slow in Las Vegas...)
* The feedback is second hand. (e.g., John said he is unhappy with your work.)
 * About second-hand feedback: 
  * Is almost always edited and unclear
  * Should be redirected to the person involved
  * Encourages fear and distrust
  * Allow people to avoid taking responsibility for direct communiation.

## How to give feedback (Situation-Bahavior-Impact SBI)
1. Capture the situation: Where or when did hte behavior occur?
 * Yesterday moring while we were inspecting the building...
 * Last week, during our regular staff meeting...
 * Today when you and I were talking in your office...
 * Last weekend at the staff party...
2. Describe the behavior: What were the specific actions that were observed?
 * What you can see
 * what you can hear
 * What the person did or did not do
 * Words and non-verbal behaviors
3. Deliver the impact: what ere the consequence of the behavior?
 * Make a statement about the person's behavior
  * When you turned in the report two days early, I was abel to consider all of your recommendations. The result was a much better final report.
  * When you ended the conversation after only 5 minutes, I wondered if you were intereested in my opinion.
 * Or acknowledge the emotional effect the behavior had on you
  * When you asked my contribution to the meeting this morning, I felt appreciated
  * When you told me my concerns were overblown, I felt discounted.
