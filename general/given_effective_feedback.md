## Goal
* give effective feedback to your boss, peers, and subordinates without blame or judgement
* understand the difference between offering an opinion and given feedback;
* understand why giving effective feedback is your most important leadership tool and kill
* be prepared to recieve feedback that you will use for your own growth and development

## Two kind of feedback
1. Opinions, thoughts, suggestions about a work product
 * How you see the situation (You personal likes and dislikes)
 * A judgement formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or observation
 * Appropriate when developing a product or a new strategy
 * Given to enable product improvement
2. Observations about behavior and the impact of the behavior
 * Focuses on behavior and impact of a specific behavior
 * Based on observations, not personal preferences
 * Is focused on improvement of an individual's behavior or performance
 * Given to enable another person's success

## What happens when effective feedback is given?
* The other walks away unerstanding exactly what he or she did and the impact the behavior had on your or the organization
* the receiver learns by repeating or avoiding that behavior in hte future
* Employee retention is increased; lack of feedback is one of the top two reasons excellent performers leave their jobs.
* Receivers feel respected. They will know how to improve.

**Giving effective feedback rquires the same attention to detail that you employ when soving a business or technical problem**
