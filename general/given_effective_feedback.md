## Goal
* give effective feedback to your boss, peers, and subordinates without blame or judgement
* understand the difference between offering an opinion and given feedback;
* understand why giving effective feedback is your most important leadership tool and kill
* be prepared to recieve feedback that you will use for your own growth and development

## Two kind of feedback
1. Opinions, thoughts, suggestions about a work product
 * How you see the situation (You personal likes and dislikes)
 * A judgement formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or observation
 * Appropriate when developing a product or a new strategy
 * Given to enable product improvement
2. Observations about behavior and the impact of the behavior
 * Focuses on behavior and impact of a specific behavior
 * Based on observations, not personal preferences
 * Is focused on improvement of an individual's behavior or performance
 * Given to enable another person's success

## What happens when effective feedback is given?
* The other walks away unerstanding exactly what he or she did and the impact the behavior had on your or the organization
* the receiver learns by repeating or avoiding that behavior in hte future
* Employee retention is increased; lack of feedback is one of the top two reasons excellent performers leave their jobs.
* Receivers feel respected. They will know how to improve.

**Giving effective feedback rquires the same attention to detail that you employ when soving a business or technical problem**

### The Johari window
Key idea:
* Individuals can build trust with others by disclosing information about themselves
* Individuals can learn about themselves with the help of feedback from others
* Self-disclosure can enlarge the open area by reduce the unknow area by others
* Feedback enlarge the open area by reduce teh unknown area by self

## Common mistakes
* The feedback judges the individual, not the behavior (e.g., you are very abrasive in meetings)
* The feed back is too vague. (e.g., lyou are a good leader)
* The feedback is exaggerated with generalities. (e.g., you always show up late to my meetings)
* The feedback analyzed motives. (e.g., you were inconsiderate by being late to our meeting.)
* The feedback goes on too long. (e.g., blah, blah, blah...)
* The feedback implies a threat. (e.g., Do you wanto succeed in this orgnization or not?)
* The feedback is a question, not a statement. (e.g., do you think you could listen next time I give instruction?)
* Bringing in your own experiences. (e.g., I used to have the same problem.)
* Cushioning the feedback. (e.g., you are not going to like this...)
* Delaying the feedback. (e.g., For years ago when we attended the trade slow in Las Vegas...)
* The feedback is second hand. (e.g., John said he is unhappy with your work.)
 * About second-hand feedback: 
  * Is almost always edited and unclear
  * Should be redirected to the person involved
  * Encourages fear and distrust
  * Allow people to avoid taking responsibility for direct communiation.

## How to give feedback (Situation-Bahavior-Impact SBI)

### Capture the situation: Where or when did the behavior occur?
 * Yesterday moring while we were inspecting the building...
 * Last week, during our regular staff meeting...
 * Today when you and I were talking in your office...
 * Last weekend at the staff party...
### Describe the behavior: What were the specific actions that were observed?
 * What you can see
 * what you can hear
 * What the person did or did not do
 * Words and non-verbal behaviors
### Deliver the impact: what ere the consequence of the behavior?
   * Make a statement about the person's behavior
     * When you turned in the report two days early, I was abel to consider all of your recommendations. The result was a much better final report.
     * When you ended the conversation after only 5 minutes, I wondered if you were intereested in my opinion.
   * Or acknowledge the emotional effect the behavior had on you
     * When you asked my contribution to the meeting this morning, I felt appreciated
     * When you told me my concerns were overblown, I felt discounted.
### Examples

> Jan, the logic of your argumentmin that meeting this morning was very persuasive. You 
> have my complete attention and your presentaion moved me from skepticism to enthusiasm.
>
> Jan, I didn't understand your argument in hte meeting this morninig. You repeated one
> point several times and were unable to answer my question. As a result, I am still skeptical
> about moving forward with the project.

-----------

> Sam, I appreciate you keepingme up to date on a weekly basis about your project.
> As a result, I've been able to pass on key information in a way that I haven't done before,
> and we were able to read a key milestone ahead of schedule.
>
> Sam, you have't kept me informat about your progress on the project. As a result,
> we missed a key milestone and I'm beginning to wonder about your ability to manage the project.

----------

> Tamara, I've noticed that you've made helpfult comments during the last three staff meetings.
> You contributions, especially about what our competition is doing in the area, helped us 
> reach better decisions and have also reflected well in our department.
>
> Tamara, I've noticed that you've been quiet during the last three staff meetings. We've
> missted the benefit of your thinking and your ability to provide us with information about

> your described will help the entire team fell comfortable moving forward with our approach.
>
> Rod, I've read the plan your submitted this morning. While it's thorough in many ways, it

> moving forward.

---------------

> Erin, I appreciate your willingness to seek input from my team gefore developing the marketing 
> plan. As a result, we are curious and involded early on. You've laid the goundwork for strong
> successfule collaboration on this project.
>
> Erin, I noticed that you have begun work on the marketing plan without consulting my team. As

-----------------

> Tom, I noticed you were one of only a few people to stay after the holiday party and clean up

>
> Tome, I noticed you left the holiday event as soon as we started cleaing up the mess. It's
> part of the culture here to join in and help after events. You missed the opportunity to 
> show that you are a team player.

### Your delivery technique
* Remember your only reason for giving feedback is to help another person succeed.
* Find a private setting and give you undivided attention.
* Soften the opening. (e.g., "May I share an observation with your?")
* When giving feedback to a direct report, be prepared ot offer suggestions and supprot for changing behavior
* Recognize that prople process information differently
* Your choice of words might be the least importand part of the feedback
* After you've given the feedback, reflect on how it went and if it did not go as planned, decide what you will do differently next time.
* Recognize that you do not have to be "comfortable" to give feedback; it's your job.
* Consider the impact of non-verbal behavior:

| Percentage   | description |
|:-------------|:-------------|
| 7%  | Of the message is communicted by workds - the content |
| 38% | by voice tone |
| 55% | by non-verbal's (posture, gestures, facial expressions, etc.)|
| 93% | of the message is NOT content|
