## Production process
Each tutorial library video typically requires the following steps
* Script authoring (4-12 hours) - Good scripts enable faster production. They are also required for the website; it makes the video content is searchable and the viewer can follow the text as they watch the movie. Lastly, they are used for translation to other languages.
* Demo setup and rehearsal (1-2 hours) - We use a VM from the Eval-Demo team or QA. Walking through the scripts and performing each step provides a final version for recording. 
* Record voiceover (2-4 hours) - Multiple takes are captured to allow splicing of content from each copy to produce a master.
* Perform screen recording (4-6 hours) - Several dry-runs are performed to ensure it flows with the audio. Multiple recordings are made to provide enough content for a single final version.
* Create graphics and animations (2-40 hours) - If needed, they are hand crafted and coordinated for movement and timing with the other content. This is a slow process, but effective for communicating conceptual pieces.
* Edit (1-4 hours, but could be longer if it's a complicated demo) - All video, audio, animations and effects are blended into a finalized video.
* Convert video and push live (2 hours) - Each video is output to an .mp4 and pushed to our host Brightcove. Additionally, all tutorials are published on YouTube and our external FTP site. 
For “quick takes” that will not appear in the tutorial library, we can use a simple screen recording with audio, edit out any unneeded content, and convert to .mp4 for rapid publication.

## Tools – Software
Camtasia the primary video and audio capture application for screen recordings. 
We also use the Adobe Creative Cloud toolset. This suite includes:
* Audition - for sound production
 * Premiere - video editing
* Photoshop and Illustrator - graphics production

For basic animation, we use Powerpoint so the content can be used by others in presentations. For more complex animations, we use Adobe Flash or After Effects.

A few different virtual machines are used as demo fixtures. Each is configured and a “snapshot” is taken so we can easily return to a starting configuration over multiple recordings.

## Tools – Hardware
The team is equipped with a Mac and PC for recording and production. Additionally, there is a PC in the Eval-Demo room which has a studio quality microphone and all software needed to capture and produce any audio and video. 

The Eval-Demo room is on the intranet web based event schedule system since it will be used by Eval-Demo and Marketing to perform customer demos and webinars on occasion.
