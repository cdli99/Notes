= Submodule

Submodules allow foreign repositories to be embedded within a dedicated subdirectory of the source tree, 
always pointed at a particular commit.
It essentially allows you to attach an external repository inside another repository at a specific path.
Submodules are meant for different projects you would like to make part of your source tree, while the
history of the two projects still stays completely independent and you cannot modify the contents of the
submodule from within the main project
